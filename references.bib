  abstract	= {Most results in the field of algorithm design are single
		  algorithms that solve single problems. In this paper we
		  discuss multidimensional divide-and-conquer, an algorithmic
		  paradigm that can be instantiated in many different ways to
		  yield a number of algorithms and data structures for
		  multidimensional problems. We use this paradigm to give
		  best-known solutions to such problems as the ECDF, maxima,
		  range searching, closest pair, and all nearest neighbor
		  problems. The contributions of the paper are on two levels.
		  On the first level are the particular algorithms and data
		  structures given by applying the paradigm. On the second
		  level is the more novel contribution of this paper: a
		  detailed study of an algorithmic paradigm that is specific
		  enough to be described precisely yet general enough to
		  solve a wide variety of problems.},
